# Simple-ML-Model

Simple machine learning model using for prediction size of neck depend on size od ankle.
In the code I've used machine learning framework statsmodels. Model was created from string formula and dataframe. 
Based on values from dataset, best method for prediction was linial regression - ols (ordinary least squares).
For creating dataframe I've used Pandas library.
